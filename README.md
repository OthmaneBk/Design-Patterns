# Design-Patterns
  Design-Patterns is a handle we can use to describe a design problem, its solutions, and consequences in a word or two. 
  Naming a pattern immediately increases our design vocabulary. It lets us design at a higher level of abstraction.
The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, so that the same construction process can create different representations.
